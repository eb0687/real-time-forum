## TODOs

- [x] learn about [sqlc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX6KzpjaPp8)
- [x] make a CRUD handler for user's table
- [x] make the file server in go (serve static files in go)
- [x] components with vanilla js
- [x] create html css for the login page and the register page
- [x] categories ([source](https://learn.reboot01.com/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/real-time-forum#posts-and-comments) )
- [ ] private chat ([source](https://learn.reboot01.com/git/root/public/src/branch/master/subjects/real-time-forum#private-messages))

  - A section to show who is online/offline and able to talk to:
  - This section must be organized by the last message sent (just like discord). If the user is new and does not present messages you must organize it in alphabetic order.
  - The user must be able to send private messages to the users who are online.
  - This section must be visible at all times.
  - Be visible, for this you will have to be able to see the previous messages that you had with the user
  - Reload the last 10 messages and when scrolled up to see more messages you must provide the user with 10 more, without spamming the scroll event. Do not forget what you learned!! (Throttle, Debounce)
  - Messages must follow a specific format:
    - A date that shows when the message was sent
    - The user name, that identifies the user that sent the message

- [ ] css for:
  - [ ] private chat
  - [ ] homepage
  - [ ] post
  - [ ] registration
  - [ ] login
  - [ ] profile

- a proper read me file

### extras:

- [ ] allow user to update their own profile?
- [ ] no mention of docker anywhere so not sure if we need to make one

## Issues

- The styling is not being applied consistently, sometimes when I manually
  refresh the page it either breaks or fixes the css.
- How to make the background color extend to the rest of the screen
- Inconsistency with showing edit button for post
- When updating a post, the title disappears



# GOD HELP
- realistic data? (FUCK DATA)
- show error message on register
- update userlist on user register
- diable fields on message when no user selected or offline user
