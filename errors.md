It sounds like you might be encountering an issue where requests are being unintentionally duplicated each time you navigate to a page. There are several potential causes for this kind of behavior in a real-time forum app (without frameworks). Here are some possibilities and how you can address them:

### 1. **Multiple Event Listeners**
   One common reason for repeated requests is if you're adding multiple event listeners for the same action (e.g., button click, page navigation) but not properly cleaning them up. Each time you navigate to a new page, new event listeners could be added without removing the old ones.

   **Solution:**
   - Make sure to remove any event listeners before adding new ones.
   ```js
   const button = document.getElementById("myButton");
   
   // Removing previous event listener before adding a new one
   button.removeEventListener("click", oldClickHandler);
   button.addEventListener("click", newClickHandler);
   ```

### 2. **Request Duplication Due to State**
   If you're not properly resetting the state or tracking whether a request is already in progress, multiple requests may be sent out when navigating to the page.

   **Solution:**
   - Add a flag that prevents duplicate requests until the current request completes.
   ```js
   let isRequestInProgress = false;

   function makeRequest() {
       if (isRequestInProgress) return;
       isRequestInProgress = true;
       // Send your AJAX request (e.g., fetch)
       fetch('your-api-endpoint')
           .then(response => response.json())
           .then(data => {
               console.log(data);
               isRequestInProgress = false; // Reset flag once the request is complete
           })
           .catch(error => {
               console.error('Error:', error);
               isRequestInProgress = false;
           });
   }
   ```

### 3. **Improper Use of `setInterval` or `setTimeout`**
   If you're using `setInterval` or `setTimeout` to make requests, it could be that you’re unintentionally starting new intervals or timeouts each time you navigate to the page, causing the requests to multiply.

   **Solution:**
   - Use `clearInterval`/`clearTimeout` to stop the previous intervals or timeouts before starting new ones.
   ```js
   let intervalId;

   function startRequestInterval() {
       if (intervalId) {
           clearInterval(intervalId); // Stop the previous interval
       }
       intervalId = setInterval(() => {
           // Make the request
           console.log('Making request...');
       }, 1000);
   }
   ```

### 4. **Single Page Application (SPA) Behavior**
   If your app is behaving like a Single Page Application (SPA) and you’re handling the navigation via JavaScript (e.g., `history.pushState` or `location.hash`), you could be unintentionally calling your request function each time a state change happens without checking if it was already made.

   **Solution:**
   - Ensure that requests are only sent once when needed. You can track the state of each page request and avoid triggering it multiple times.
   ```js
   let pageLoaded = false;

   function navigateToPage() {
       if (pageLoaded) return;
       pageLoaded = true;
       makeRequest();
   }
   ```

### 5. **Browser Cache or Service Worker Issue**
   Sometimes, if the browser or a service worker is caching resources incorrectly, it could result in unexpected multiple requests.

   **Solution:**
   - Disable cache for development purposes.
   - Use the browser's Developer Tools to inspect network activity and confirm which requests are being sent.

### 6. **Check for Multiple Calls to `window.location` or `history.pushState()`**
   If you have multiple navigations happening in rapid succession due to a programmatic issue, it could trigger multiple requests.

   **Solution:**
   - Ensure you’re not unintentionally calling page navigation code multiple times. Use `console.log()` to track each navigation event to ensure they happen only when intended.

### 7. **Duplicate Form Submissions or Button Clicks**
   If your request is tied to form submissions or button clicks, ensure that you’re not accidentally triggering multiple submissions.

   **Solution:**
   - Use `preventDefault()` to stop form submissions from firing multiple times.
   ```js
   const form = document.getElementById("myForm");
   form.addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
       event.preventDefault();  // Prevent the form from submitting multiple times
       // Handle form submission logic here
   });
   ```

### Debugging Tips:
- Use `console.log()` or breakpoints in the developer console to track where and when the duplicate requests are being made.
- Open the Network tab in the browser's developer tools to monitor the requests and identify which ones are being sent multiple times.

By addressing these common issues and debugging your JavaScript code accordingly, you should be able to prevent the duplicate requests and fix the problem you're encountering.
